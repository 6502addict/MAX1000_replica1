40col-tty directory contains the legacy Apple 1 programs from Vince Briel Replica 1
for these programs configure the terminal in 40 column TTY
the Apple 1 has a dumb terminal without any cursor control
to start the basic type:
E000R

the upload the basic file
uploading a basic file is tricky the basic is slow to digest a basic line event at 15Mhz
set the pause per char to 0ms and the pause per line to at least 30ms
some programs works some don't work I have no idea of the basic used by Vince Briel

80col-tty directory contains AI generated games
at 15Mhz pause per char at 0 and pause per line at 7 is ok
the goal is not the game itself but to show how to program in c on the replica 1 with cc65
(cc65 need to be patched with replica1 target)


40col-vt100 is a tetris game generated by Claude Sonnet...
could be improved but still usable
